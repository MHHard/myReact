            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 1:</h4>
              <p>Connect your wallet by clicking on the “Connect Wallet” button above in order to begin your cross-chain transfer.</p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="../images/step1.png" alt="How to Connect your wallet to begin your cross chain transfer between Ethereum and Moonbeam."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 2:</h4>
              <p>Select “Ethereum Mainnet” in the “From” dropdown menu, select “Moonbeam” in the “To” dropdown menu, and then select the asset type you wish to bridge to Moonbeam.</p>
              <p><span class="step-note">Please Note:</span> You will have to switch your wallet’s network to Ethereum Mainnet in order to perform the cross-chain bridging your selected token from Ethereum to Moonbeam. </p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="img/step2.png" alt="How to transfer tokens and coins from Ethereum to Moonbeam."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 3:</h4>
              <p>Input the amount of the token you selected that you would like to transfer from Ethereum to Moonbeam in the “Send:” field. The estimated amount of that asset that is to be bridged to Moonbeam will be displayed in the “Receive (estimated)” field. </p>

              <h2>Ethereum Mainnet Information </h2>
              <p>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that provides open access to digital money and data-friendly services. It is a community-built technology that is responsible for Ether (ETH) also referred to as Ethereum, as well as many different decentralized applications (dApps) that many people use today. With their tools and unique programming language, Solidity, Ethereum’s users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, while using its Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency as payment. Ethereum allows you to move money, or make agreements, directly with someone else while serving as a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording those transactions.</p>

              <h2>Moonbeam Information</h2>
              <p>As a major parachain of the Polkadot ecosystem, Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible parachain on Polkadot. Since Polkadot allows its users to create their own blockchains (parachains) that are directly connected to Polkadot's main relay chain. The vision behind Moonbeam is that, while it operates on Polkadot, it is able to connect to and interact with the Ethereum blockchain similar to how Evmos connects the Cosmos ecosystem to the EVM compatible ecosystem. Moonbeam is both interoperable and compatible with Ethereum and combines the best of both, the familiar and easy-to-use tools of Ethereum and the scalable, interoperable architecture of Polkadot.<br><br>Similar to other chains, Glimmer (GLMR) is the native utility token of Moonbeam.

            <h2>What is a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>Blockchain or Crypto bridges work just like the real thing, but instead of connecting physical places together, they are used to connect digital ecosystems together. These bridges can pass both information and assets between the bridged blockchains. We call this a cross-chain transfer.</p>
            <p>As an example, if you have a need to use USDT on Moonbeam, and you have USDT on Ethereum Mainnet and not on Moonbeam, you could either deposit more USDT specifically on Moonbeam, or you could find a Moonbeam bridge that will bridge your USDT from Ethereum Mainnet to Moonbeam so you do not have to spend more to get additional USDT just because it is on Moonbeam. </p>   
            <p>There are also <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/introduction/fungible-token-bridging-models' class='a-config' target='_blank'>different types of bridging</a> in terms of how the cross-chain transfer is done from a technical standpoint. There is liquidity-based bridging where there are liquidity pools of an asset on both the source and destination blockchains. There is also canonical-based bridging where an asset is locked on the source chain and a new asset that represents that locked asset is created on the destination chain.</p>
            <p>Bridging and cross-chain transfers are not limited to just normal assets or fungible tokens either. Bridges can transfer and move non-fungible tokens (NFTs) between chains as well. cBridge supports 2 main models when it comes to NFT bridging, pegged NFT bridging and multi-chain native (MCN) NFT bridging. Pegged NFT bridging is similar to the canonical-based bridging mentioned above. The NFT is locked on the source chain and a new NFT that represents that locked NFT is created, or minted, on the destination chain. In the MCN NFT bridging model, however, a MCN NFT does not have the notion of “origin chain” or "original NFT". When transferring an MCN NFT from chain A to chain B, the only pattern is "Burn-and-Mint" so that there is always only one NFT across all of the chains.</p>
            <p>Then there are the different levels of “trust” you can have in a crypto bridge. The two main types are trusted and trustless bridges. Trusted bridges depend on a central system or entity and require you to put your trust in them if you wish to use their bridge. Trustless bridges, like our own cBridge, are completely controlled by and run on automated smart contracts and algorithms that have the same security and stability as the blockchain itself.</p>
            <p>Things start to get a more complex from there so if you are interested in learning more about the different types of bridges and the tech behind them, you can read through our documents here: <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/</a></p>

            <h2>What are the Benefits of Using a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons you may want to use a bridge to do a cross-chain transfer between different blockchains:</p>
            <h4>Lower transaction fees</h6>
            <p>You can take advantage of platforms with lower transaction fees and higher speeds when compared to more congested chains, like Ethereum Mainnet. Especially when exploring different decentralized applications (dApps). You can look at alternative chains, like BNB Chain, and bridge your USDC, or whatever other asset you wish to bridge, from Ethereum to BNB Chain. You can then get some of that chain’s utility token and will be able to enjoy the lower transaction fees and higher speeds afforded to chains like BNB Chain.</p>
            <h4>Take advantage of other dapps and opportunities on different blockchains</h6>
            <p>If you’ve been providing liquidity for lending out USDC on Ethereum Mainnet, but see that the interest rate for lending USDC on Moonbeam is significantly higher; you can use a cross-chain transfer to move your USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to Moonbeam in order to take advantage of that higher interest rate.</p>
            <h4>Explore other blockchain ecosystems</h6>
            <p>The Web3 world is growing fast and you now have more options than ever before when it comes to different blockchains and dApps on those chains. There are many different compelling reasons why developers are building on the chains they are and with all of this diversity it makes it difficult to select a chain to invest in. Bridges and cross-chain transfers help solve this issue. By giving you the ability to bridge assets like ETH, USDT, USDC, and BTC to different chains, this opens up your options when it comes to being able to explore alternate L1 chains and the native dapps and services that they provide.</p>
