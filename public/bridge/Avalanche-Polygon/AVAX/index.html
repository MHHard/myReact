            <h2>How to Bridge AVAX from Avalanche Network to Polygon</h2>
            <p>Celer <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>cBridge</a> makes it quick, easy, and secure to bridge AVAX from Avalanche Network to Polygon and from Polygon to Avalanche Network by following these simple steps:</p>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 1:</h4>
              <p>Connect your wallet by clicking on the “Connect Wallet” button above in order to begin your cross-chain transfer.</p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="../../images/step1.png" alt="How to Connect your wallet to begin your cross chain transfer between Avalanche and Polygon."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 2:</h4>
              <p>Select “Avalanche” in the “From” dropdown menu, select “Polygon” in the “To” dropdown menu, and select “AVAX” for the asset type you wish to bridge to Polygon.</p>
              <p><span class="step-note">Please Note:</span> You will have to switch your wallet’s network to Avalanche Network in order to perform the cross-chain bridging of AVAX from Avalanche to Polygon. </p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="img/step2.png" alt="How to transfer AVAX from Avalanche to Polygon."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 3:</h4>
              <p>Input the amount of AVAX you would like to transfer from Avalanche to Polygon in the “Send:” field. The estimated amount of wrapped AVAX (muxAVAX) that will be bridged to Polygon will be displayed in the “Receive (estimated)” field. </p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="img/step3.png" alt="Bridging AVAX from Avalanche to Polygon."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 4:</h4>
              <p>Review all of the Polygon bridge transfer information and AVAX estimates. If all of the cross-chain bridging transaction information is correct and acceptable, click the “Transfer” button and approve the transaction prompts to begin the cross-chain transfer.</p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="img/step4.png" alt="Cost and time estimates when bridging AVAX from Avalanche to Polygon."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 5:</h4>
              <p>Wait for your cross-chain bridge transaction to Polygon to complete. You will then receive your wrapped AVAX (muxAVAX) on Polygon. </p>
              <p><span class="step-note">Please Note:</span> Most cross-chain transfers are completed almost instantaneously, however some may take as long as 20 minutes to complete depending on how much traffic the chain is experiencing.</p>
              <p>If you wish to see more details about the bridge transaction from Avalanche to Polygon, you can click the links in your “Transfer History” tab.</p>

              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>AVAX is the native cryptocurrency of <a href='https://www.avax.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>Avalanche</a> with 720 million AVAX coins in circulation.  AVAX is used to help drive development across the network and can be used for staking and paying for transaction fees. It can also be used in proposing and voting on future network upgrades. In other words, AVAX is the currency of Avalanche and the applications running on it. Whether you want to simply transfer some AVAX between wallets, receive some bridged tokens from another chain like Ethereum Mainnet, or use an application someone had built on Avalanche; anytime you interact with Avalanche you will be required to pay a small fee in AVAX.<br><br>Our cross-chain bridge, cBridge, supports the cross-chain bridging of AVAX <span><img class='describe-img' src='https://get.celer.app/cbridge-icons/AVAX.png' alt=''/></span> between multiple chains with the fastest speeds, lowest costs, and most secure transactions available. The full name of this asset is Avalanche and the ticker of this asset is AVAX.</p>

                <h2 id="from-chain-name">Avalanche Network Information </h2>
                <p>Avalanche, as a layer one blockchain, is an open programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications. Similar to other layer one blockchains, Avalanche supports a wide spectrum of applications related to DeFi, gaming, NFTs, the metaverse, as well as support for stablecoins. Avalanche is composed of three key components that make up the blockchain: (1). The Platform Chain (P-Chain) which coordinates validators and the creation of subnets, (2). the C-Chain for the creation of smart contracts, and (3). the X-Chain for managing and exchanging assets.<br><br>As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible platform, applications that are built using the Ethereum programming language Solidity are also able to be deployed on Avalanche with minimal modifications. This enables developers from one of the largest and widely adopted blockchain communities to build on Avalanche and to deploy custom private or public blockchains as “subnets.”</p>

                <h2 id="to-chain-name">Polygon Information</h2>
                <p>Polygon is a layer-2 network that aims to be a scaling solution that provides multiple tools to improve the speed, reduce cost, and reduce the complexity of transactions and transfers on more congested and expensive blockchains like Ethereum. As a layer-2 network, Polygon acts as an add-on layer to Ethereum that isn’t looking to change the original blockchain layer. Polygon wishes to help enable Ethereum to expand in size, security, efficiency, and usefulness. All while seeking to spur developers to bring enticing products to market. The token underpinning the network is called MATIC and is used as the unit of payment and settlement between participants who interact within Polygon.</p>

            <h2>What is a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>Blockchain or Crypto bridges work just like the real thing, but instead of connecting physical places together, they are used to connect digital ecosystems together. These bridges can pass both information and assets between the bridged blockchains. We call this a cross-chain transfer.</p>
            <p>As an example, if you have a need to use AVAX on Polygon, but you have AVAX on Avalanche Network and not on Polygon, you could either deposit more AVAX directly on Polygon or you could find a Polygon bridge that will bridge your AVAX from Avalanche Network to Polygon so you do not have to spend more to get additional AVAX just because that AVAX is already on Polygon. </p>   
            <p>There are also <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/introduction/fungible-token-bridging-models' class='a-config' target='_blank'>different types of bridging</a> in terms of how the cross-chain transfer is done from a technical standpoint. There is liquidity-based bridging where there are liquidity pools of an asset on both the source and destination blockchains. There is also canonical-based bridging where an asset is locked on the source chain and a new asset that represents that locked asset is created on the destination chain.</p>
            <p>Bridging and cross-chain transfers are not limited to just normal assets or fungible tokens either. Bridges can transfer and move non-fungible tokens (NFTs) between chains as well. cBridge supports 2 main models when it comes to NFT bridging, pegged NFT bridging and multi-chain native (MCN) NFT bridging. Pegged NFT bridging is similar to the canonical-based bridging mentioned above. The NFT is locked on the source chain and a new NFT that represents that locked NFT is created, or minted, on the destination chain. In the MCN NFT bridging model, however, a MCN NFT does not have the notion of “origin chain” or "original NFT". When transferring an MCN NFT from chain A to chain B, the only pattern is "Burn-and-Mint" so that there is always only one NFT across all of the chains.</p>
            <p>Then there are the different levels of “trust” you can have in a crypto bridge. The two main types are trusted and trustless bridges. Trusted bridges depend on a central system or entity and require you to put your trust in them if you wish to use their bridge. Trustless bridges, like our own cBridge, are completely controlled by and run on automated smart contracts and algorithms that have the same security and stability as the blockchain itself.</p>
            <p>Things start to get a more complex from there so if you are interested in learning more about the different types of bridges and the tech behind them, you can read through our documents here: <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/</a></p>

            <h2>What are the Benefits of Using a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons you may want to use a bridge to do a cross-chain transfer between different blockchains:</p>
            <h4>Lower transaction fees</h6>
            <p>You can take advantage of platforms with lower transaction fees and higher speeds when compared to more congested chains, like Ethereum Mainnet. Especially when exploring different decentralized applications (dApps). You can look at alternative chains, like BNB Chain, and bridge your USDC, or whatever other asset you wish to bridge, from Ethereum to BNB Chain. You can then get some of that chain’s utility token and will be able to enjoy the lower transaction fees and higher speeds afforded to chains like BNB Chain.</p>
            <h4>Take advantage of other dapps and opportunities on different blockchains</h6>
            <p>If you’ve been providing liquidity for lending out USDT on Avalanche Network, but see that the interest rate for lending USDT on Polygon is significantly higher; you can use a cross-chain transfer to move your USDT from Avalanche Network to Polygon in order to take advantage of that higher interest rate.</p>
            <h4>Explore other blockchain ecosystems</h6>
            <p>The Web3 world is growing fast and you now have more options than ever before when it comes to different blockchains and dApps on those chains. There are many different compelling reasons why developers are building on the chains they are and with all of this diversity it makes it difficult to select a chain to invest in. Bridges and cross-chain transfers help solve this issue. By giving you the ability to bridge assets like ETH, USDT, USDC, and BTC to different chains, this opens up your options when it comes to being able to explore alternate L1 chains and the native dapps and services that they provide.</p>
