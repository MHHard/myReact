            <h2>How to Bridge from BNB Chain to Avalanche Network</h2>
            <p>Celer <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>cBridge</a> makes it quick, easy, and secure to bridge assets like USDT, USDC, and more from BNB Chain to Avalanche Network and from Avalanche Network to BNB Chain by following these simple steps:</p>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 1:</h4>
              <p>Connect your wallet by clicking on the “Connect Wallet” button above in order to begin your cross-chain transfer.</p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="../images/step1.png" alt="How to Connect your wallet to begin your cross chain transfer between Binance and Avalanche."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 2:</h4>
              <p>Select “BNB Chain” in the “From” dropdown menu, select “Avalanche” in the “To” dropdown menu, and then select the asset type you wish to bridge to Avalanche.</p>
              <p><span class="step-note">Please Note:</span> You will have to switch your wallet’s network to BNB Chain in order to perform the cross-chain bridging your selected token from Binance to Avalanche. </p>
              <div class="step-img-block" ><img class="step-img" src="img/step2.png" alt="How to transfer tokens and coins from Binance to Avalanche."/></div>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 3:</h4>
              <p>Input the amount of the token you selected that you would like to transfer from Binance to Avalanche in the “Send:” field. The estimated amount of that asset that is to be bridged to Avalanche will be displayed in the “Receive (estimated)” field. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="step">
              <h4>Step 5:</h4>
              <p>Wait for your cross-chain bridge transaction to Avalanche Network to complete. You will then receive your bridged tokens on Avalanche. </p>
              <p><span class="step-note">Please Note:</span> Most cross-chain transfers are completed almost instantaneously, however some may take as long as 20 minutes to complete depending on how much traffic the chain is experiencing.</p>
              <p>If you wish to see more details about the bridge transaction from Binance to Avalanche, you can click the links in your “Transfer History” tab.</p>

              <h2>BNB Chain Information </h2>
              <p>The BNB Chain, often referred to as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or the Binance Chain, is composed of both the BSC and Binance Chain combined. The BNB Chain (abbreviation for “Build, ‘N Build”) enables BNB Chain governance for things like staking and voting.It also remains Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. The BNB Chain aims to increase interoperability across the blockchain ecosystem and develop the core infrastructure to enable and connect the “world’s parallel virtual environment.” With more new and improved features than its two separate parts, the BNB Chain has a boosted BSC throughout, is able to introduce an on-chain governance mechanism, have one-to-many chain scaling, and has overall improved scaling solutions. Plus  it has expanded the number of BSC validator sets from 21 to 41!<br><br>The six key pillars of the BNB Chain include being permissionless, decentralized, open, multichain accessible, designed for creators and inventors, and with the goal to be bigger than Binance itself.</p>

              <h2>Avalanche Network Information</h2>
              <p>Avalanche, as a layer one blockchain, is an open programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications. Similar to other layer one blockchains, Avalanche supports a wide spectrum of applications related to DeFi, gaming, NFTs, the metaverse, as well as support for stablecoins. Avalanche is composed of three key components that make up the blockchain: (1). The Platform Chain (P-Chain) which coordinates validators and the creation of subnets, (2). the C-Chain for the creation of smart contracts, and (3). the X-Chain for managing and exchanging assets.<br><br>As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible platform, applications that are built using the Ethereum programming language Solidity are also able to be deployed on Avalanche with minimal modifications. This enables developers from one of the largest and widely adopted blockchain communities to build on Avalanche and to deploy custom private or public blockchains as “subnets.”</p>

            <h2>What is a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>Blockchain or Crypto bridges work just like the real thing, but instead of connecting physical places together, they are used to connect digital ecosystems together. These bridges can pass both information and assets between the bridged blockchains. We call this a cross-chain transfer.</p>
            <p>As an example, if you have a need to use USDT on Avalanche Network, and you have USDT on BNB Chain and not on Avalanche Network, you could either deposit more USDT specifically on Avalanche Network, or you could find an Avalanche bridge that will bridge your USDT from BNB Chain to Avalanche Network so you do not have to spend more to get additional USDT just because it is on Avalanche. </p>   
            <p>There are also <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/introduction/fungible-token-bridging-models' class='a-config' target='_blank'>different types of bridging</a> in terms of how the cross-chain transfer is done from a technical standpoint. There is liquidity-based bridging where there are liquidity pools of an asset on both the source and destination blockchains. There is also canonical-based bridging where an asset is locked on the source chain and a new asset that represents that locked asset is created on the destination chain.</p>
            <p>Bridging and cross-chain transfers are not limited to just normal assets or fungible tokens either. Bridges can transfer and move non-fungible tokens (NFTs) between chains as well. cBridge supports 2 main models when it comes to NFT bridging, pegged NFT bridging and multi-chain native (MCN) NFT bridging. Pegged NFT bridging is similar to the canonical-based bridging mentioned above. The NFT is locked on the source chain and a new NFT that represents that locked NFT is created, or minted, on the destination chain. In the MCN NFT bridging model, however, a MCN NFT does not have the notion of “origin chain” or "original NFT". When transferring an MCN NFT from chain A to chain B, the only pattern is "Burn-and-Mint" so that there is always only one NFT across all of the chains.</p>
            <p>Then there are the different levels of “trust” you can have in a crypto bridge. The two main types are trusted and trustless bridges. Trusted bridges depend on a central system or entity and require you to put your trust in them if you wish to use their bridge. Trustless bridges, like our own cBridge, are completely controlled by and run on automated smart contracts and algorithms that have the same security and stability as the blockchain itself.</p>
            <p>Things start to get a more complex from there so if you are interested in learning more about the different types of bridges and the tech behind them, you can read through our documents here: <a href='https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/' class='a-config' target='_blank'>https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/</a></p>

            <h2>What are the Benefits of Using a Blockchain/Crypto Bridge?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons you may want to use a bridge to do a cross-chain transfer between different blockchains:</p>
            <h4>Lower transaction fees</h6>
            <p>You can take advantage of platforms with lower transaction fees and higher speeds when compared to more congested chains, like Ethereum Mainnet. Especially when exploring different decentralized applications (dApps). You can look at alternative chains, like BNB Chain, and bridge your USDC, or whatever other asset you wish to bridge, from Ethereum to BNB Chain. You can then get some of that chain’s utility token and will be able to enjoy the lower transaction fees and higher speeds afforded to chains like BNB Chain.</p>
            <h4>Take advantage of other dapps and opportunities on different blockchains</h6>
            <p>If you’ve been providing liquidity for lending out USDC on BNB Chain, but see that the interest rate for lending USDC on Avalanche Network is significantly higher; you can use a cross-chain transfer to move your USDC from BNB Chain to Avalanche Network in order to take advantage of that higher interest rate.</p>
            <h4>Explore other blockchain ecosystems</h6>
            <p>The Web3 world is growing fast and you now have more options than ever before when it comes to different blockchains and dApps on those chains. There are many different compelling reasons why developers are building on the chains they are and with all of this diversity it makes it difficult to select a chain to invest in. Bridges and cross-chain transfers help solve this issue. By giving you the ability to bridge assets like ETH, USDT, USDC, and BTC to different chains, this opens up your options when it comes to being able to explore alternate L1 chains and the native dapps and services that they provide.</p>
